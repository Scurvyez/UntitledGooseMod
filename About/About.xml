Geese cannot be trusted.
Geese can periodically enter various mental states.
They may start stealing items from your storage and taking them anywhere they see fit.
They may lock on to one unfortunate child and terrorize them for an unspecified time.
Colonists can be ordered to stop the geese from continuing their shenanigans. It is not guaranteed the colonist will succeed though.
